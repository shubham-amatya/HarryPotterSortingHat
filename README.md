# HarryPotterSortingHat
The Sorting Hat is a sentient hat at Hogwarts that magically determines which of the four school Houses each new student belongs most to. These four Houses are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. The Sorting Hat originally belonged to Godric Gryffindor, one of the four founders of Hogwarts.
 During the opening banquet at the beginning of each school year, the first-year students are lined up and their names read aloud alphabetically. 
The four houses have different entry requirements, and nobody summed them up better than the old Sorting Hat itself in its welcoming song...

Gryffindor
Notable members include (of course) Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.

‘You might belong in Gryffindor,
Where dwell the brave at heart,
Their daring, nerve and chivalry
Set Gryffindors apart.’
Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone
