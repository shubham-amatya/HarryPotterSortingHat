# HarryPotterSortingHat
The Sorting Hat is a sentient hat at Hogwarts that magically determines which of the four school Houses each new student belongs most to. These four Houses are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. The Sorting Hat originally belonged to Godric Gryffindor, one of the four founders of Hogwarts.
 During the opening banquet at the beginning of each school year, the first-year students are lined up and their names read aloud alphabetically.
