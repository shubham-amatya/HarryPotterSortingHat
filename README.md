# HarryPotterSortingHat
The Sorting Hat is a sentient hat at Hogwarts that magically determines which of the four school Houses each new student belongs most to. These four Houses are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. The Sorting Hat originally belonged to Godric Gryffindor, one of the four founders of Hogwarts.
The Sorting Hat sorts you into different houses based on analysis drawn from a series of answers that the user gives.
